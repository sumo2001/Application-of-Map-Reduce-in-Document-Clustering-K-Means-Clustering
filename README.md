# Application-of-Map-Reduce-in-Document-Clustering-K-Means-Clustering
Big Data is the current talk. Document Clustering is another trend in the fields of Machine Learning. Before applying Document Clustering, it is necessary to collect all distinct terms from each document and process them as tokens. Tokens are then grouped as Term-Frequency table using fast algorithms. One such algorithm is Map Reduce â€“ an application of parallel and distributed computing in building the frequencies of each document faster than before. The master node distributes data among worker nodes which process the data in a parallel fashion for each document. Thus, our objective is to build Map Reduce paradigm  Where big data and handling big data is a always a big problem in the present generation where map reduce is on one of the way and to increase efficiency we will be combing map reduce with k-means and combiner clustering which reduces overheads
